To convert the spreadsheet of people into json I had to do the following:
1. Select the 'ChosenBy' column (I changed the name from 'Chosen By' to ChosenBy to make it easier to decode)
2. Select 'Format->Number->Plain Text'
3. Find and replace (with the C column still selected) and replace "," with "".
4. Download as csv then use: https://www.csvjson.com/csv2json to convert it into json
